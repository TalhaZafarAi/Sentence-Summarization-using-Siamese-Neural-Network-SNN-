## Sentence Summarization using Siamese Neural Network (SNN)
Sentence Summarization using SNN leverages similarity metrics, TF-IDF vectorization, and binary classification. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models enhance categorization by learning text patterns. Transformer-based Text Classification (TTC), using models like BERT, achieves high performance by deeply understanding contextual information.

### Features

- **Siamese Neural Network (SNN) Architecture**
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**
- **Binary Classification**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Transformer-based Text Classification (TTC)**

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- numpy
- torch
- torchvision
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/sentence-summarization-snn.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed:

    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

4. Start the Jupyter Notebook server:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open a new tab in your web browser showing the Jupyter Notebook dashboard. Navigate to the location of your `Sentence_Summarization.ipynb` file and click on it to open it. You can now run the code cells in the notebook by pressing Shift + Enter.

5. If you specifically want to run the code in the notebook using Python outside of Jupyter Notebook, you can convert the notebook to a Python script:

    ```bash
    jupyter nbconvert --to script Sentence_Summarization.ipynb
    ```

    This will create a .py file that you can then run using the `python` command. However, note that some functionalities of Jupyter Notebook, such as interactive widgets, may not work in a regular Python script.

6. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python Sentence_Summarization.py
    ```

### Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load your dataset and apply TF-IDF vectorization for text preprocessing.
2. **Define and Compile Model**: Implement the Siamese Neural Network architecture with LSTM for sentence summarization.
3. **Train the Model**: Train the SNN model using your dataset to learn sentence similarities.
4. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualize the results.
